-- Thank you for giving goose a try!
-- 
-- This file was automatically created running goose init. If you're familiar with goose
-- feel free to remove/rename this file, write some SQL and goose up. Briefly,
-- 
-- Documentation can be found here: https://pressly.github.io/goose
--
-- A single goose .sql file holds both Up and Down migrations.
-- 
-- All goose .sql files are expected to have a -- +goose Up directive.
-- The -- +goose Down directive is optional, but recommended, and must come after the Up directive.
-- 
-- The -- +goose NO TRANSACTION directive may be added to the top of the file to run statements 
-- outside a transaction. Both Up and Down migrations within this file will be run without a transaction.
-- 
-- More complex statements that have semicolons within them must be annotated with 
-- the -- +goose StatementBegin and -- +goose StatementEnd directives to be properly recognized.
-- 
-- Use GitHub issues for reporting bugs and requesting features, enjoy!

-- +goose Up
SELECT 'up SQL query';

-- +goose Down
SELECT 'down SQL query';
