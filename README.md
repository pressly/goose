# goose

Goose is a database migration tool. Manage your database schema by creating incremental SQL changes or Go functions.

### Goals of this fork

`github.com/pressly/goose` is a fork of `bitbucket.org/liamstask/goose` with the following changes:
- No config files
- [Default goose binary](./cmd/goose/main.go) can migrate SQL files only
- Go migrations:
    - We don't `go build` Go migrations functions on-the-fly
      from within the goose binary
    - Instead, we let you
      [create your own custom goose binary](examples/go-migrations),
      register your Go migration functions explicitly and run complex
      migrations with your own `*sql.DB` connection
    - Go migration functions let you run your code within
      an SQL transaction, if you use the `*sql.Tx` argument
- The goose pkg is decoupled from the binary:
    - goose pkg doesn't register any SQL drivers anymore,
      thus no driver `panic()` conflict within your codebase!
    - goose pkg doesn't have any vendor dependencies anymore
- We use timestamped migrations by default but recommend a hybrid approach of using timestamps in the development process and sequential versions in production.

# Install

    $ go get -u github.com/pressly/goose/cmd/goose

This will install the `goose` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

For a lite version of the binary without DB connection dependent commands, use the exclusive build tags:

    $ go build -tags='no_postgres no_mysql no_sqlite3' -i -o goose ./cmd/goose

```

## create

Create a new SQL migration.

    $ goose create add_some_column sql
    $ Created new file: 20170506082420_add_some_column.sql

Edit the newly created file to define the behavior of your migration.

You can also create a Go migration, if you then invoke it with [your own goose binary](#go-migrations):

    $ goose create fetch_user_data go
    $ Created new file: 20170506082421_fetch_user_data.go

## up

Apply all available migrations.

    $ goose up
    $ OK    001_basics.sql
    $ OK    002_next.sql
    $ OK    003_and_again.go

## up-to

Migrate up to a specific version.

    $ goose up-to 20170506082420
    $ OK    20170506082420_create_table.sql

## up-by-one

Migrate up a single migration from the current version

    $ goose up-by-one
    $ OK    20170614145246_change_type.sql

## down

Roll back a single migration from the current version.

    $ goose down
    $ OK    003_and_again.go

## down-to

Roll back migrations to a specific version.

    $ goose down-to 20170506082527
    $ OK    20170506082527_alter_column.sql

## redo

Roll back the most recently applied migration, then run it again.

    $ goose redo
    $ OK    003_and_again.go
    $ OK    003_and_again.go

## status

Print the status of all migrations:

    $ goose status
    $   Applied At                  Migration
    $   =======================================
    $   Sun Jan  6 11:25:03 2013 -- 001_basics.sql
    $   Sun Jan  6 11:25:03 2013 -- 002_next.sql
    $   Pending                  -- 003_and_again.go

Note: for MySQL [parseTime flag](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#parsetime) must be enabled.

## version

Print the current version of the database:

    $ goose version
    $ goose: version 002

# Migrations

goose supports migrations written in SQL or in Go.

## SQL Migrations

A sample SQL migration looks like:

```sql
-- +goose Up
CREATE TABLE post (
    id int NOT NULL,
    title text,
    body text,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

-- +goose Down
DROP TABLE post;
```

Notice the annotations in the comments. Any statements following `-- +goose Up` will be executed as part of a forward migration, and any statements following `-- +goose Down` will be executed as part of a rollback.

By default, all migrations are run within a transaction. Some statements like `CREATE DATABASE`, however, cannot be run within a transaction. You may optionally add `-- +goose NO TRANSACTION` to the top of your migration
file in order to skip transactions within that specific migration file. Both Up and Down migrations within this file will be run without transactions.

By default, SQL statements are delimited by semicolons - in fact, query statements must end with a semicolon to be properly recognized by goose.

More complex statements (PL/pgSQL) that have semicolons within them must be annotated with `-- +goose StatementBegin` and `-- +goose StatementEnd` to be properly recognized. For example:

```sql
-- +goose Up
-- +goose StatementBegin
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION histories_partition_creation( DATE, DATE )
returns void AS $$
DECLARE
  create_query text;
BEGIN
  FOR create_query IN SELECT
      'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS histories_'
      || TO_CHAR( d, 'YYYY_MM' )
      || ' ( CHECK( created_at >= timestamp '''
      || TO_CHAR( d, 'YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00' )
      || ''' AND created_at < timestamp '''
      || TO_CHAR( d + INTERVAL '1 month', 'YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00' )
      || ''' ) ) inherits ( histories );'
    FROM generate_series( $1, $2, '1 month' ) AS d
  LOOP
    EXECUTE create_query;
  END LOOP;  -- LOOP END
END;         -- FUNCTION END
$$
language plpgsql;
-- +goose StatementEnd
```

## Go Migrations

1. Create your own goose binary, see [example](./examples/go-migrations)
2. Import `github.com/pressly/goose`
3. Register your migration functions
4. Run goose command, ie. `goose.Up(db *sql.DB, dir string)`

A [sample Go migration 00002_users_add_email.go file](./examples/go-migrations/00002_rename_root.go) looks like:

```go
package migrations

import (
	"database/sql"

	"github.com/pressly/goose"
)

func init() {
	goose.AddMigration(Up, Down)
}

func Up(tx *sql.Tx) error {
	_, err := tx.Exec("UPDATE users SET username='admin' WHERE username='root';")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}

func Down(tx *sql.Tx) error {
	_, err := tx.Exec("UPDATE users SET username='root' WHERE username='admin';")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
```

# Hybrid Versioning
Please, read the [versioning problem](https://github.com/pressly/goose/issues/63#issuecomment-428681694) first.

We strongly recommend adopting a hybrid versioning approach, using both timestamps and sequential numbers. Migrations created during the development process are timestamped and sequential versions are ran on production. We believe this method will prevent the problem of conflicting versions when writing software in a team environment.

To help you adopt this approach, `create` will use the current timestamp as the migration version. When you're ready to deploy your migrations in a production environment, we also provide a helpful `fix` command to convert your migrations into sequential order, while preserving the timestamp ordering. We recommend running `fix` in the CI pipeline, and only when the migrations are ready for production.
