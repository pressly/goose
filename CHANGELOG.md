## [Unreleased]

## [v3.17.0] - 2023-12-15

- Standardised the MIT license (#647)
- Improve provider `Apply()` errors, add `ErrNotApplied` when attempting to rollback a migration
  that has not been previously applied. (#660)
- Add `WithDisableGlobalRegistry` option to `NewProvider` to disable the global registry. (#645)

  no timeout. (#627)

- Allow setting / resetting the global Go migration registry. (#602)

The motivation behind the Provider was simple - to reduce global state and make goose easier to
consume as an imported package.

Here's a quick summary:

- Avoid global state
- Make Provider safe to use concurrently
- Unlock (no pun intended) new features, such as database locking
- Make logging configurable
- Better error handling with proper return values
- Double down on Go migrations
- ... and more!

## [v3.15.1] - 2023-10-10

- Fix regression that prevented registering Go migrations that didn't have the corresponding files
  available in the filesystem. (#588)
  - If Go migrations have been registered globally, but there are no .go files in the filesystem,
    **always include** them.
  - If Go migrations have been registered, and there are .go files in the filesystem, **only
    include** those migrations. This was the original motivation behind #553.
  - If there are .go files in the filesystem but not registered, **raise an error**. This is to
    prevent accidentally adding valid looking Go migration files without explicitly registering
    them.

## [v3.15.0] - 2023-08-12

- Fix `sqlparser` to avoid skipping the last statement when it's not terminated with a semicolon
  within a StatementBegin/End block. (#580)
- Add `go1.21` to the CI matrix.
- Bump minimum version of module in go.mod to `go1.19`.
- Fix version output when installing pre-built binaries (#585).

## [v3.14.0] - 2023-07-26

- Filter registered Go migrations from the global map with corresponding .go files from the
  filesystem.
  - The code previously assumed all .go migrations would be in the same folder, so this should not
    be a breaking change.
  - See #553 for more details
- Improve output log message for applied up migrations. #562
- Fix an issue where `AddMigrationNoTxContext` was registering the wrong source because it skipped
  too many frames. #572
- Improve binary version output when using go install.

## [v3.13.4] - 2023-07-07

- Fix pre-built binary versioning and make small improvements to GoReleaser config.
- Fix an edge case in the `sqlparser` where the last up statement may be ignored if it's
  unterminated with a semicolon and followed by a `-- +goose Down` annotation.
- Trim `Logger` interface to `Printf` and `Fatalf` methods only. Projects that have previously
  implemented the `Logger` interface should not be affected, and can remove unused methods.

## [v3.13.1] - 2023-07-03

- Add pre-built binaries with GoReleaser and update the build process.

## [v3.13.0] - 2023-06-29

- Add a changelog to the project, based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
- Update go.mod and retract all `v3.12.X` tags. They were accidentally pushed and contain a
  reference to the wrong Go module.
- Fix `up` and `up -allowing-missing` behavior.
- Fix empty version in log output.
- Add new `context.Context`-aware functions and methods, for both sql and go migrations.
- Return error when no migration files found or dir is not a directory.
