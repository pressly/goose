## [Unreleased]

## [v3.15.0] - 2023-08-12

- Fix `sqlparser` to avoid skipping the last statement when it's not terminated with a semicolon
  within a StatementBegin/End block. (#580)
- Add `go1.21` to the CI matrix.
- Bump minimum version of module in go.mod to `go1.19`.
- Fix version output when installing pre-built binaries (#585).

## [v3.14.0] - 2023-07-26

- Filter registered Go migrations from the global map with corresponding .go files from the
  filesystem.
  - The code previously assumed all .go migrations would be in the same folder, so this should not
    be a breaking change.
  - See #553 for more details
- Improve output log message for applied up migrations. #562
- Fix an issue where `AddMigrationNoTxContext` was registering the wrong source because it skipped
  too many frames. #572
- Improve binary version output when using go install.

## [v3.13.4] - 2023-07-07

- Fix pre-built binary versioning and make small improvements to GoReleaser config.
- Fix an edge case in the `sqlparser` where the last up statement may be ignored if it's
  unterminated with a semicolon and followed by a `-- +goose Down` annotation.
- Trim `Logger` interface to `Printf` and `Fatalf` methods only. Projects that have previously
  implemented the `Logger` interface should not be affected, and can remove unused methods.

## [v3.13.1] - 2023-07-03

- Add pre-built binaries with GoReleaser and update the build process.

## [v3.13.0] - 2023-06-29

- Add a changelog to the project, based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
- Update go.mod and retract all `v3.12.X` tags. They were accidentally pushed and contain a
  reference to the wrong Go module.
- Fix `up` and `up -allowing-missing` behavior.
- Fix empty version in log output.
- Add new `context.Context`-aware functions and methods, for both sql and go migrations.
- Return error when no migration files found or dir is not a directory.
